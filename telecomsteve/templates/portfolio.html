                <p>Homelab is my personal sandbox for hosting and testing microservices in the cloud.
                    The environment runs an autoscaling instance of Kubernetes. 
                    Both the Kubernetes cluster itself and microservices within have been deployed using a mix of Terraform, Helm, Ansible and Bash scripting. 
                    Full documentation is located within the repositories wiki pages on github.

                <p>During periods of early growth, Twitter deployed a number of isolated and non-standard phone systems
                    that had become expensive and difficult to support.
                    To manage the complexity, Twitter hired me to unify its networks and migrate them to cloud
                    deployment.

                    The result was a fully virtualized phone network, combined with a Twilio Cloud SIP trunking.
                    This new design reduced recurring carrier costs 72%.
